Her friends decide to find men who will try to woo her and marry her before her birthday. They hire four different men, played by Ashmit Patel, Nikhil Chinappa, Gaurav Kapoor and Sachin Khedekar, to pose as Anjali's suitors. However, things get complicated when Anjali finds out about the bet and refuses to marry any of them.
