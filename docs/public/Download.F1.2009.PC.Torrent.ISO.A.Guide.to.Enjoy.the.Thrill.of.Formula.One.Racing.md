2. Download the torrent file and open it with your torrent client software. Choose a folder where you want to save the game file and start the download. The game file should be in ISO format, which is a disc image file that contains all the data of the game.

But how does F1 2009 play? Well, that depends on how you want to play it. The game offers a range of difficulty levels and driver aids that can make it as easy or as hard as you like. You can turn on or off features such as braking assist, traction control, anti-lock brakes, racing line, and damage. You can also choose between automatic or manual transmission, and adjust the AI of your opponents. The game also supports various control schemes, including the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, the Classic Controller, the GameCube Controller, and the official F1 2009 Racing Wheel accessory.
 
With all the assists on and the AI low, F1 2009 is a breeze to play. You can zip around the tracks with minimal effort, and enjoy the sensation of speed and overtaking. The game does a good job of recreating the look and feel of the real F1 tracks, with authentic sponsors, banners, and crowds. The graphics are not spectacular, but they are decent enough for a Wii game. The sound effects are also satisfactory, with realistic engine noises and radio messages from your pit crew.
 
However, if you are looking for a more realistic and challenging F1 experience, you might be disappointed by F1 2009. Even with all the assists off and the AI high, the game still feels too arcadey and forgiving. The physics are not very realistic, and the cars handle too easily. You can bounce off walls and other cars without much consequence, and you can cut corners without penalty. The damage model is also very basic, and does not affect your performance much. The weather effects are also underwhelming, and do not change the driving dynamics significantly.
